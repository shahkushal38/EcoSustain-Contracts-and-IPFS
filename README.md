Project Topic - EcoSustain - A sustainable decentralised solution for socio-environmental problems of the surroundings

Problem Statement - 

In many countries, citizens face significant challenges in raising complaints related to socio-environmental issues like garbage dumps and wastage, community health, safety and security. This is due to the lack of a proper system for reporting these issues anonymously and the fear of reprisals from local authorities. Furthermore, the complaints raised by citizens may not be acted upon by the authorities due to a lack of proper documentation or proof of the complaints.

To address these challenges, we propose the development of an application that enables individuals to register complaints anonymously using blockchain technology. The application will provide a secure and transparent way for citizens to report socio-environmental problems and the information will be stored on a decentralized blockchain network, ensuring that the data cannot be tampered with.

The data will contain proof as images, which will be secured and resistent from tampering by storing it in an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) powering the Distributed Web.

By using blockchain technology, the application will ensure that the anonymity of the individuals raising complaints is maintained, and the complaints are documented in a secure and transparent manner. NGOs and authorities can access the complaints registered on the blockchain and take necessary actions to address the issues raised. Further, these NGOs and autonomous government authorities shall be incentivized with NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) upon solving the problem as a token of appreciation for the good work carried on by them.
